# AllAboutGraphs
Project to demonstrate graph data structure and graph related algorithms

* Seperate data structure and algorithm. E.g. Graph is a data structure and DFS is a algorithm processing on Graph data structure.

   * Advantage: divide and conquer / single responsibility. Code is not mixed up, not too complicated.
